Research Interests
======
My research experiences have made me interested in questions about how automation and analytical chemistry can be exploited to increase our speed in developing and understanding chemical systems. My PhD work introduced me to this concept through the development and use of automated high-throughput reaction screening tools. Since then, my time as an engineering postdoctoral scientist has expanded my knowledge base to include methodologies for utilizing data produced from analytical instrument in intelligent ways, i.e through automated optimization. My future research goals are to continue integrating new analytical chemistry tools with automated platforms in order to answer the question of interests in even faster timeframes. This effort will require an interdisciplinary approach combining engineering, chemistry, and computer science. <br>

My experiences in engineering, computer science, and chemistry has shown me that the new generation of students will need to have skills in each of these fields in order to excel in the future workplace. I am interested in exploring ways to fully integrate programming, mathematics, kinetics, and other related topics into the undergraduate curriculum. This may include integrating programming with python into the curriculum. This will allow newly graduated chemist to better communicate with their engineering and science colleagues. <br>


Hobbies
======
Over the years and through all travels I have become quite addicted history and culture and often express this through cooking cuisines of the respective cultures. My fianc√©e and I also enjoy camping, symphony orchestras (the Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra is a must see), and gardening. We are always looking for new opportunities to expand our cultural awareness.


If you'd like to collaborate or have any questions about me or my work I'm very responsive to <a href="mailto:m.wleklinski@lilly.com">email</a>.
